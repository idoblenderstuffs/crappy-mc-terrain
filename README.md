idoblenderstuffs' really bad Minecraft terrain clone

i made this in a few weeks for my GCSE school project just to look into the computer science behind voxel worlds.
it's not really any good, it's just a proof of concept, really.

this repo isn't meant for anyone to fork (i don't know why you'd want to) considering it doesn't have all the files set up,
it is just meant to demonstrate the important bits of code and that used to create this.

runs really slow, doesn't look super great, only made for educational purposes.

there's a .pdf file here that shows the contents of my GCSE art book too, so you can see explenations behind stuff and the thought process behind it.
